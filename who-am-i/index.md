Cyber security passionate, part-time developer and sys-admin, blogger. 
Master student in "Information Security", bachelor in "Computer Systems and Network Security" @ University of Milan.

My passion for IT started when I was seven years old, and I developed my computer skills ever since then.
As an autodidact, I began my studies with the fundamentals of computer programming in Microsoft environments. 
Afterwards, I learnt the Unix-like systems, using mainly Linux and BSD, and I developed a considerable interest towards the opensource ethics and point of view.

When I started to explore IRC channels, I became passionate in cyber security.
