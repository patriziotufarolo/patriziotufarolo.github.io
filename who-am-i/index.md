Cyber security analyst, part-time developer and sys-admin, blogger; graduated in "Information Security" with bachelor in "Computer Systems and Network Security" @ University of Milan.

My passion for IT started when I was seven years old, and I developed my computer skills ever since then.
As an autodidact, I began my studies with the fundamentals of computer programming in Microsoft environments. 
Afterwards, I learnt the Unix-like systems, using mainly Linux and BSD, and I developed a considerable interest towards the opensource ethics and point of view.

I lately worked as a consultant in Telecom Italia for NTT DATA as cyber security analyst, performing offensive security activities like vulnerability assessments and infrastructural penetration tests.
I am currently working as CERT analyst in Banca d'Italia.
