As of this year I will take part at **Living Lab**, a pre-incubation project started at the Computer Science department of *University of Milan*.
The project I am currently working at is **iCertify**, an innovative platform that offers to professionals the opportunity to collect and share their certified competences and to headhunters the possibility to implement a certification-aware hiring process.
You can find more informations about the project [here](http://livinglab.di.unimi.it/project/icertify/), and [this](http://livinglab.di.unimi.it/staff/patrizio-tufarolo/) is my personal page on Living Lab's website.
