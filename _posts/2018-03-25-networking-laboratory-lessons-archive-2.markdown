I've uploaded on GitHub the latest version of the slides I made for the networking laboratory class which I've supported during the a.ys. 2015/2016 and 2016/2017.
The slides are available [here](https://github.com/patriziotufarolo/NetworkingLabSlides/).

Also I've published some scripts to solve the exercises proposed in the slides.
You can find them  [here](https://github.com/patriziotufarolo/imunes_exercises/).

Bye :)
