My name is Patrizio.

Your name was Luke.

I am a human.
You were a cat.

I deal with cyber security and safety in the digital world.
Your main occupation? Cuddles: we loved each other.

I haven't been able to keep you safe in the real one.
You've been killed by someone who loves to drive fast.

Please, forgive me.

Rest in peace.
